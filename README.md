# hackbi-vi-photoshop-photopea

## Get Started
Mainly a web browser since we will be using Photopea for the people without Photoshop.  

## Uses
You can use Photoshop/Photopea to make things such as posters, advertisements, themes, and other appliances that could bring an appeal to whatever you are doing.  

## Purpose
People should choose my workshop to give their project a visually appealing aspect, or just to learn how to use Photoshop/Photopea since it is very common.  

## Goal
I will teach the basics of how to use Photoshop/Photopea in order for students to make their projects look the best they can. I will try to go through the most important tools and commands.  

## Challenges
The teaching points will be me explaining the tool or command to the class, and then asking them to do it on an example work piece, so that if they need help they can ask.
